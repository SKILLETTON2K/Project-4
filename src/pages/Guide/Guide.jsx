    <h1>Guide to Schematics</h1>

    <p>
    Wonder how to use Schematics? Fear no longer, all you'll need is your Minecraft world, and a world edit plugin or mod!<br></br>
    If you need a access to one of those, use the link at the bottom of the page! <br></br>
    First you will need to open your .minecraft folder, if you're on Windows. In the start bar type '%appdata%' and it should be located there!<br></br>
    Second, open the .minecraft folder, then go into the worldedit folder. In there you can drag the file you downloaded here, (Or any .schem file!) <br></br>
    And drag it into that 'schematics' folder where you are currently located. <br></br><br></br>

    Awesome! Now all you need to do is sign into the world you wish to apply the build to, once you are where you would like to place it, type '//wand'.<br></br>
    Then after that you'll want to type '//schem load (file name)'. Then all you need to do is type '//paste'! <br></br>
    Don't worry, if it doesn't paste where you want it, you can type '//undo' and try again! It may take a few tries!
